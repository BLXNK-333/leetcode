"""
Given a string s, return the maximum length of a substringÂ such that it
contains at most two occurrences of each character.

Example 1:
Input: s = "bcbbbcba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 4 and contains at most two occurrences
of each character: "bcbbbcba".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The following substring has a length of 2 and contains at most two occurrences
of each character: "aaaa".

Constraints:
2 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
