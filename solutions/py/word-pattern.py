"""
Given a pattern and a string s, find if sÂ follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter
in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:
Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.

Example 1:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Explanation:
The bijection can be established as:
'a' maps to "dog".
'b' maps to "cat".

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= pattern.length <= 300
pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
1 <= s.length <= 3000
s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.
